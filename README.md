#DCSummerMealSites

This is an accessible map (by means of the google maps JavaScript API) of DC containing the locations 
listed in their Summer Meals program for kids 18 and younger. This file should be used in some sort of 
XAMP or lamp stack. I used XAMPP control panel (If thats the way you wanna go then throw this in htdocs
and upload the dataset https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/DCGIS::summer-meals-sites/about to phpMyAdmin)

# a stable build is up at https://dcmealsites.williamfield.in/
